### Exercise 3.5

Given: 
Suppose that the discrete random variable $X$ has a cumulative distribution function given by: 


Find the Possible values and the probability mass function of $X$.

$F(X) = \begin{cases} 0, if&x < 1\\ \frac{1}{3} if 1 \le x < \frac{4}{3} \\1, if \\end{cases}$

Solution:

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
